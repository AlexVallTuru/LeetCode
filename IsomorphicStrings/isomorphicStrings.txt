Given two strings and , determine if they are isomorphic.st

Two strings and are isomorphic if the characters in can be replaced to get .stst

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and consist of any valid ascii character.t
